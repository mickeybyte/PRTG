# PRTG Custom Lookup files
The files in here are PRTG Custom Lookup definitions used by several of my PRTG custom Powershell scripts. 

The files need to be placed in <PRTG Installation folder>\Lookups\Custom

When the files are copied or updated, you need to reload the custom lookups (Setup - System Administration - Administrative Tools) before you can use them.
